# LegacyLearn
## About the app:
LegacyLearn is a mentorship platform that connects retired professionals with students seeking to learn new skills. Retirees can share their experience, earn income, and stay socially active, while students benefit from personalized, one-on-one guidance that goes beyond self-learning through videos or courses.

The system provides secure profile verification, AI-driven mentor recommendations, and a safe booking flow. Students can request a session after reviewing a mentor’s skills and hourly rate; mentors can review the student’s profile before accepting. Once confirmed, the class can take place online (via recorded video calls) or in-person (with safeguards such as verified profiles and optional session recordings).

## Key features include:

1. Verified onboarding for both students and mentors.

2. AI-powered skill matching using vector similarity + LLM explanations.

3. Secure online payments through Stripe (test mode in MVP).

4. Recorded sessions for accountability (online via Jitsi, offline via uploaded recordings).

5. Mutual acceptance workflow — bookings happen only if both sides agree.
